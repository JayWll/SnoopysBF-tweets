# @[SnoopysBF](https://twitter.com/SnoopysBF) Tweets

Charlie Brown has a twitter, but he doesn't know how to use a phone, and he has no thumbs anyway.

This bot tweets for him. It's triggered by [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org/) every five minutes.

## How does it work?

It's all based on random numbers. The code runs every five minutes, and if its daytime there's a one in 55 chance that a tweet gets posted as a result. Tweets are between one and five words long, each word is a coin toss between "woof" and "bark," and there's some punctuation thrown in there too.
