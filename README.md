@[SnoopysBF](https://twitter.com/SnoopysBF) Tweets
==================================================

[Charlie Brown has a twitter](https://twitter.com/snoopysbf), but he doesn't know how to use a smartphone, and he has no thumbs anyway.

This bot tweets for him. It's triggered by [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org/) every five minutes.


How does it work?
-----------------

It's all based on random numbers. The code runs every five minutes, and if its daytime there's a one in 55 chance that a tweet gets posted as a result. Tweets are between one and five words long, each word is a coin toss between "woof" and "bark," and there's some punctuation thrown in there too.
